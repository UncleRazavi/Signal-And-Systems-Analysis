# Signal and Systems Project

## Overview

This project explores various concepts in signal processing and systems analysis. It includes the generation of different signals, computation of their impulse responses, convolution of signals, and analysis using Fourier series and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The project aims to demonstrate how signals can be manipulated and analyzed in both time and frequency domains.

## Features

- **Signal Generation**: Defines and generates different types of signals such as cosine, exponential decay, and unit step.
- **Impulse Response**: Computes and plots the impulse response of a defined system.
- **Convolution**: Implements a convolution algorithm to compute the output of the system in response to different input signals.
- **Fourier Series Coefficients**: Computes Fourier series coefficients for the defined signals and reconstructs the signals using these coefficients.
- **Frequency Response**: Calculates the system's frequency response and applies it to the input signals using FFT.
